# WMT22 Term-Based Evaluation Metric for Legal Texts
[//]: <> (repository name: wmt22-term-based-metric)
This repository contains the code for the automatic term-based evaluation metric, which is beneficial for the use in translation of the legal texts.
### Code
The full code and its description will be posted here later (by beginning of December).
### Data
The data used for testing the suggested metric is the [ELITR agreement corpus](https://github.com/ELITR/agreement-corpus). 
The scores of the widespread automated metrics that we checked against ours are taken from the results from [WMT2021 News Track](https://github.com/wmt-conference/wmt21-news-systems/tree/main/scores).
### Papers
The suggested metric will be presented at the poster session of the [Workshop on Machine Translation-2022](https://statmt.org/wmt22/) (Dec 7-8, 2022). The paper will be posted here after the publication.
